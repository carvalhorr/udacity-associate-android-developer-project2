# Movie Database

This is a complete app that displays popular and best rated movies. The data is obtained from 
The Movie Db api. Intructions on how to setup the a api key is given below.

It was developed as part of the coursework for the Udacity Associate Android Developer 
Fast Track nanodegree.

## The movie db api key
In order to use the app it is necessary to obtain an api key from [the movie db API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). 

After getting an api key set it up in the development environment so that Gradle can load it into the project:
- create a file named api.properties under /app directory
- include a value for the movie database api key in the format: movie_db_api_key="your api key goes here"
- replace the text "your api key goes here" with your api key
